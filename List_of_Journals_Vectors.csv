      2D Materials aims to curate the most significant and cutting-edge research being undertaken in the field of 2D materials science and engineering. Serving an expanding multidisciplinary community of researchers and technologists, our goal is to develop a selective journal dedicated to bringing together the most important new results and perspectives from across the discipline. Submissions should be essential reading for a particular sub-field, but should also be of multidisciplinary interest to the wider community, with the expectation that published work will have significant impact.

Submissions that do not meet 2DM's strict acceptance criteria may be transferred at the discretion of the journal's editors (with author approval) to other relevant journals in the IOP portfolio, for further consideration.
2D Materials is a multidisciplinary journal devoted to publishing original research of the highest quality and impact covering all aspects of two-dimensional materials, including fundamental properties (experiments, theory and simulations), novel applications (electrical, mechanical, chemical and biomedical) and synthesis/fabrication techniques. Specific materials of interest will include (but are not limited to):

Graphene and graphene-derived materials (such as graphene oxides, graphene quantum dots etc)
Silicene and germanene/silicane and germanane
Boron nitride
Transition metal dichalcogenides
2D topological insulators
Complex oxides
Composite materials
Other novel 2D layered structures
In addition to publishing research articles that report urgent breakthrough results of significant importance to the field of two-dimensional materials, 2D Materials also publishes Perspectives and invited-only Topical Reviews on themes of particular current interest to the community.        ","

o the journal does not publish articles that simply propose disguised variants of known methods without adequate validation (e.g., metaheuristics that are claimed to be “effective” on the sole basis of metaphorical comparisons with natural or artificial systems and processes). New methods must be presented in metaphor-free language by establishing their relationship with classical paradigms.

      The mission of Annals is to publish up-to-date, in-depth and integrative reviews of research advances in management. Often called ""reviews with an attitude,"" Annals papers summarize and/or challenge established assumptions and concepts, pinpoint problems and factual errors, inspire discussions, and illuminate possible avenues for further study. Reviews published in Annals move above and beyond descriptions of the field – they motivate conceptual integration and set agendas for future research.

'It's an exceptional volume—and exceptionally timely to boot. I found myself trying to put this new Annals in perspective. I tried, in particular, to cast a rather hard and critical light on this volume: Just how essential is it for the time-starved and besieged scholar to have yet another thing to keep up with? Do we really need, in short, yet another annual volume? The answer I gave myself to this question was a resounding, ''Yes!'''
Review in International Public Management Journal (2008)

ANNALS is released in January and July.        ","
      The mission of Annals is to publish up-to-date, in-depth and integrative reviews of research advances in management. Often called ""reviews with an attitude,"" Annals papers summarize and/or challenge established assumptions and concepts, pinpoint problems and factual errors, inspire discussions, and illuminate possible avenues for further study. Reviews published in Annals move above and beyond descriptions of the field – they motivate conceptual integration and set agendas for future research.

'It's an exceptional volume—and exceptionally timely to boot. I found myself trying to put this new Annals in perspective. I tried, in particular, to cast a rather hard and critical light on this volume: Just how essential is it for the time-starved and besieged scholar to have yet another thing to keep up with? Do we really need, in short, yet another annual volume? The answer I gave myself to this question was a resounding, ''Yes!'''

Intangible heritage, such as music, performance, storytelling, and mythology.

      The Journal of Emerging Technologies in Computing Systems invites submissions of original technical papers describing research and development in emerging technologies in computing systems. Major economic and technical challenges are expected to impede the continued scaling of semiconductor devices. This has resulted in the search for alternate mechanical, biological/biochemical, nanoscale electronic, asynchronous and quantum computing and sensor technologies. As the underlying nanotechnologies continue to evolve in the labs of chemists, physicists, and biologists, it has become imperative for computer scientists and engineers to translate the potential of the basic building blocks (analogous to the transistor) emerging from these labs into information systems. Their design will face multiple challenges ranging from the inherent (un)reliability due to the self-assembly nature of the fabrication processes for nanotechnologies, from the complexity due to the sheer volume of nanodevices that will have to be integrated for complex functionality, and from the need to integrate these new nanotechnologies with silicon devices in the same system.

      Computer Communication Review (CCR) is an online publication of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication (SIGCOMM) and publishes articles on topics within the SIG's field of interest. Technical papers accepted to CCR typically report on practical advances or the practical applications of theoretical advances. CCR serves as a forum for interesting and novel ideas at an early stage in their development. The focus is on timely dissemination of new ideas that may help trigger additional investigations. While the innovation and timeliness are the major criteria for its acceptance, technical robustness and readability will also be considered in the review process. We particularly encourage papers with early evaluation or feasibility studies.         ","

      TRETS is the top journal focusing on research in, on, and with reconfigurable systems and on their underlying technology. The scope, rationale, and coverage by other journals are often limited to particular aspects of reconfigurable technology or reconfigurable systems. TRETS is a journal that covers reconfigurability in its own right.

Topics that would be appropriate for TRETS would include all levels of reconfigurable system abstractions and all aspects of reconfigurable technology including platforms, programming environments and application successes that support these systems for computing or other applications.

-The board and systems architectures of a reconfigurable platform.
-Programming environments of reconfigurable systems, especially those designed for use with reconfigurable systems that will lead to increased programmer productivity.
-Languages and compilers for reconfigurable systems.
-Logic synthesis and related tools, as they relate to reconfigurable systems.
-Applications on which success can be demonstrated.

The underlying technology from which reconfigurable systems are developed. (Currently this technology is that of FPGAs, but research on the nature and use of follow-on technologies is appropriate for TRETS.)
In considering whether a paper is suitable for TRETS, the foremost question should be whether reconfigurability has been essential to success. Topics such as architecture, programming languages, compilers, and environments, logic synthesis, and high performance applications are all suitable if the context is appropriate. For example, an architecture for an embedded application that happens to use FPGAs is not necessarily suitable for TRETS, but an architecture using FPGAs for which the reconfigurability of the FPGAs is an inherent part of the specifications (perhaps due to a need for re-use on multiple applications) would be appropriate for TRETS.

      ACS Infectious Diseases is the first journal to highlight chemistry and its role in the multidisciplinary and collaborative field of infectious disease research. The scope of the journal encompasses all aspects of chemistry relating to infectious diseases research including research on pathogens, host-pathogen interactions, therapeutics, diagnostics, vaccines, drug-delivery systems, and other biomedical technology development pertaining to infectious diseases.

With editors well-versed in both chemistry and the biology of infectious diseases, the journal aims to bridge the gap between these two disciplines. ACS Infectious Diseases welcomes submission of articles with a balance of chemistry and biology, and encourages discussions centered on specific pathogen- and disease-related issues.
