Issues feature advances in the use of deep-brain stimulation, imaging-guided techniques in stereotactic biopsy and craniotomy, stereotactic radiosurgery, and stereotactically implanted and stereotactically guided radiotherapeutics and biologicals in the treatment of functional and movement disorders, brain tumors, and other diseases of the brain. Background information from basic science laboratories related to such clinical advances provides the reader with an overall perspective of this field. Proceedings and abstracts from many of the key international meetings furnish an overview of this specialty available nowhere else. Stereotactic and Functional Neurosurgery meets the information needs of both investigators and clinicians in this rapidly advancing field.        ',\n",

       " '\\r\\n      A Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A (ZNA) is an international scientific journal which publishes original research papers from all areas of experimental and theoretical physics. Authors are encouraged to pay particular attention to a clear exposition of their respective subject, addressing a wide readership. In accordance with the name of our journal, which means “Journal for Natural Sciences”, manuscripts submitted to ZNA should have a tangible connection to actual physical phenomena. In particular, we welcome experiment-oriented contributions.\\r\\n\\r\\nManuscripts considered for publication in A Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A undergo high-level refereeing. Mere formal correctness of a paper is not sufficient for its acceptance. Moreover, articles reporting a merely marginal extension of already existing knowledge are considered unsatisfactory. Instead, the key quality a publication in A Journal of Physical Sciences: Zeitschrift für Naturforschung A should possess is that it makes a genuine contribution to the advancement of its topic.\\r\\n\\r\\nTopics:\\r\\n-Atomic, Molecular & Chemical Physics-\\r\\nDynamical Systems & Nonlinear Phenomena-\\r\\nGravitation & Cosmology-\\r\\nHydrodynamics-\\r\\nQuantum Theory-\\r\\nSolid State Physics & Materials Science-\\r\\nThermodynamics & Statistical Physics \\r\\n        ',\n",
